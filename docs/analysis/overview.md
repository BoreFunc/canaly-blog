# Overview

CAJ files are proprietary file formats, so the only way to parse them is to reverse engineer them. (Well you can guess if you're lucky, but that's not the case here.)
The lucky thing is that with the help of modern technologies, we can do this a lot easier than before.

## What is CAJ?
CAJ, or Chinese Academic Journal, is widely used to store articles, books, and other documents. 
First, a clarification: CAJ is not a file format, but a set of file formats, the most common of which is CAJ and all the file formats are end with `.caj` extension.
